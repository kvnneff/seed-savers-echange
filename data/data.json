In his book, Dr. Weaver suggests an interesting way to consume this pepper: “I have often been tempted to call this the Pennsylvania Dutch jalapeño, since it can be used like a jalapeño in cookery. The Pennsylvania Dutch who pickle it whole often serve it stuffed with peanut butter; which makes an interesting hors d’oeuvre, especially when eaten with salt pretzels and beer.”(Capsicum annuum) Plants 2-2½' tall and somewhat sprawling; carrot-shaped fruit, 1½-3\" long, ripen to deep red-orange; good fruit set; smoky hot flavor and thin flesh."

Dr. Weaver included this variety in his 1997 book Heirloom Vegetable Gardening and wrote, “This rare and very old heirloom is believed to have been introduced or developed in the nineteenth century by Mennonite horticulturist Jacob B. Garber (1800-1886) of Lancaster County. It was preserved for many years by the Martin family of Ephrata, Pennsylvania.” Dr. Weaver acquired the variety directly from the Martin family in 1971. In his book, Dr. Weaver suggests an interesting way to consume this pepper: “I have often been tempted to call this the Pennsylvania Dutch jalapeño, since it can be used like a jalapeño in cookery. The Pennsylvania Dutch who pickle it whole often serve it stuffed with peanut butter; which makes an interesting hors d’oeuvre, especially when eaten with salt pretzels and beer.”(Capsicum annuum) Plants 2-2½' tall and somewhat sprawling; carrot-shaped fruit, 1½-3\" long, ripen to deep red-orange; good fruit set; smoky hot flavor and thin flesh."

When Margaret married Graham in 1936 and moved with him to Tennessee, she brought seeds of her parents’ cucumber variety with her. Margaret and Graham’s son, Robert, remembers that this was the only cucumber his parents grew in their garden each year. The family most often ate the fruit fresh in salads, but sometimes used them for pickles as well. At some point during the 1950s, the variety was nearly lost—the entire seed stock had been planted, but no seeds had germinated due to dry weather. Fortunately, in the following year, a volunteer plant came up. Graham carefully nurtured the plant and was able to rebuild a seed stock.(Cucumis sativus) Short, blocky fruit, 2-5\" long, 1½-2\" diameter; pale white-green skin; subtle flavor, slightly sweet, not bitter; crisp, moist flesh and tender skin."
